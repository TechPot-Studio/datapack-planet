## Styleguide
### JavaScript, TypeScript and JSX, TSX
Code lint is using eslint.\
ProTip: This is just a suggestion. Even we may not be able to fully comply. 

- There should be a space **after** comma (`,`).
- There should be a space **after** type qualifier (`:`).
- There should be a space **before/after** operator (e.g.: `+`, `-`, `=`).
- There should be a semicolon(`;`) in the end of each call or assignment statement.
- Using single quote instead double quote.
- No non assignment or call statement appears.
- JSX single-line value references should have space **before/after** the value.
- import/export should have space in the **start/end** of the curly-braces (`{ }`).
- Using `===` instead `==`
- Using four spaces to indent
  - The `index.ts` is generated by electron forge template, which is two spaces.
- Use ES import instead of `require`
- Most naming should be camelCase
- Class and react component should be PascalCase
- No namespace
- Use react hooks instead ES class components
- Use inline export default if can
- No `eval` and `new Function()`
- No curly braces and braces around the params if can
